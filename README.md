NEWM-N 315 Homework Two
For this homework, I created the website called "Pretty Little Liars: The Next Generation Universe." It's a fan website where you can learn and shocked at the same time on all the characters and the sequence of events.
Constructing the website, I used:

- MVC, app.js, and model.js
- SASS
- HTML and CSS, as usual
- installing the package.json and package.lock.json

But, there is one problem: all those four links are broken and didn't clicked to see contents to contents. Even though I have already coded it properly including the simple MVC and the model.js, those links didn't work and I needed to check or verified the links with Shelton. 
So, when I "open live server" on the VSC, the website pops up and when clicking those links, there are actually contents. For example, when clicking the home nav, it actually shows the content on the home page. But when I clicked the about nav, liars nav, or the mystery nav, it actually see another content, but different.
