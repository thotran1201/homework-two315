NEWM-N 315 Homework Two
For this homework, I created the website called "Pretty Little Liars: The Next Generation Universe." It's a fan website where you can learn and shocked at the same time on all the characters and the sequence of events.
Constructing the website, I used:

- MVC, app.js, and model.js
- SASS
- HTML and CSS, as usual
- installing the package.json and package.lock.json
